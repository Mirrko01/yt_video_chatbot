{"text": " Red Dead Redemption 2 is a sprawling tale set in a fictional version of the American South in the last year of the 19th century. The full story spans almost a decade and takes anywhere from 40 to 100 hours to complete. It's definitely worth playing, but if you don't have that kind of time, we've got you covered. Here's the short, short version of Red Dead Redemption 2. Okay, so you play as this guy, Arthur Morgan. He's the main dude to this guy, Dutch Vanderlyn, who leads this gang that's on the run after screwing up a robbery real bad. The gang's got like 20 people in it, but the most important ones are this dude, Dutch's girlfriend, the guy you played as in the last game, his main squeeze and their son, camp mom, and this sleazy asshole. They need a lot of money fast, so they rob a train and set up camp outside of town to do more crime so they can retire way out west. This world has its consolations. Problem is, the dude that owned that train is super pissed and hires Pinkerton detective and Pete Postlethwaite look-alike contest winner Agent Milton and his little buddy, Edgar Ross, to hunt down Dutch and bring him to justice. They offer Arthur his freedom in exchange for Dutch, but Arthur says fuck off and the gang packs up and heads south. A lot happens when the gang's down south, but the big takeaway is that there is two feuding families that Dutch and Hosea try to pull a fast one on to con them out of all of their, I don't know, confederacy? The Confederate gold? Dutch said we was to keep on dealing with them until we find this gold. Arthur, Dutch, and Bill get deputized, kill some moonshiners, have some fun blowing up clansmen, everything's great. Until both houses realize that they're being played. Sean gets killed and John's son Jack gets kidnapped. Where's my goddamn son? Prompting some truly righteous vengeance on old Dutch's part. Of course, the law shows up again, which means we're back on the move, this time to New Orleans. I mean, Saint Denis, where the guy the Braithwaite sold Jack to lives. Yeah, I know, let's not get into it. Anyways, they get Jack back, and though it looks like this crime boss could be a cool dude, he tries to set everyone up, and so Dutch again goes a little bit medieval on him. You repulsive little maggot! Prompting more than a few raised eyebrows around the gang. Okay, so now Dutch says the plan is to get out of the country, grow mangoes in Tahiti or wherever. Then Tahiti, the Fiji Islands, or this place New Guinea, dancing girls. But they need one last big score to get themselves enough money to get there. Let's rob this bastard. This goes about as well as you'd expect. Milton shows up and kills Hosea. Don't! Lenny beefs it also. John is arrested, and Arthur, Bill, Dutch, Micah, and Javier end up stowing away on a boat to Cuba that sinks and strands them on an island called Guarma. They take care of some business with the locals there and hop on a boat back to the good old U.S. of A. Arthur rides to their old hideout. Then we learn that the gang moved to this super kitschy swamp village to get away from the law. Of course, wouldn't you know it? Guess who shows up right as it happens? Everyone gets back together. We are here to arrest you! They run them off and start looking for yet another new campsite while Dutch starts freaking out that somebody's a traitor. Now we get into really serious spoiler territory, because Arthur gets the super cool news that he has tuberculosis, a gnarly lung disease that he probably got from that sick farmer he beat up way back at the beginning of the game. Armed with the knowledge of almost certain death and questioning a lot of his life choices, Arthur helps the gang move up north, where Molly comes home yelling about how she met with the cops. Susan does not like that one bit. She's like, From here, things go from bad to all out full blown jibbit-show. Dutch is becoming completely unhinged, he's paranoid of like everybody and makes some really bad calls. Arthur's basically got depression. I'm worried my path is coming to an end, Mr. Swanson. And Micah is really cementing his role as douchebag extraordinaire by convincing Dutch it's a good idea to manipulate the local indigenous population to war against the U.S. Army to take heat off the gang. About the only good thing that happens is that Arthur gets to ride in a hot tub. He's a hot air balloon and he and Sadie bust John out of jail. Everything comes to a head when the gang goes after what Dutch is promising will be their last, last big score. One score and one whole hell of a lot of noise. A train carrying payroll to the local army fort. During the heist, John is injured and Dutch claims he couldn't save him despite trying, and when they regroup they learn that Abigail's been captured by Pinkerton Pete. Of course, Dutch bails, which is pretty much the last straw for Arthur, who rides with Sadie to rescue Abigail. They do, sort of. With Milton telling them that Michael was the real rat, not Molly. Just before Abigail gives him a lead makeover. Telling Sadie to get Abigail and Jack to safety, Arthur rides back to camp while another cool song plays and you get reminded of all the good or bad shit you did during the game. You confront Dutch, who is now officially the worst, and basically sides with Micah just because it's easier. John shows up, also pissed at Dutch for leaving him for dead, and then the party really gets started when the law shows up. The Pinkertons chase Arthur and John up into the hills, and here Arthur either sacrifices himself to help John get his family to safety, or dies attempting to recover the money from the train heist. Depending on your choices throughout the game, Dutch shows up to forsake his surrogate son one last time, and Arthur is either killed by Micah like a chump, or succumbs peacefully to his illness as the sun rises. The end, right? Nope. There's still like ten hours of story left. Fast forward eight years to 1907. John Marston now goes by Jim Milton, which is like the nerdiest name he could have picked. Milton. Jim Milton. And he, Abigail, and Jack find themselves living and working on a ranch. Try as he might to go straight, John keeps getting pulled back into dangerous scenarios like the one in the movie. And eventually Abigail leaves, taking Jack with her. Wanting to make a better life for his family, John takes a massive loan from the bank, buys a ranch, and gets down on some sweet, sweet montage action with old friends Uncle and Charles Smith. Abigail and Jack eventually return, but it's just in time for Sadie to show up and say that she knows where Micah's hiding. Still pissed about the whole ruin the gang thing, John, Sadie, and Charles ride up into the mountains to confront the handlebar jerkwad. He's not alone though, as it turns out, Dutch took that whole easy route thing and really ran with it. However, now confronted by all of his mistakes once again, he's left alone. Dutch kills Micah and walks away, leaving the loot from the robbery for John and his wounded compatriots. Marston returns to his family to live out the rest of his life in peace. At least until the cops show up and then Red Dead 1 happens. And there you have it. That's pretty much the story of Red Dead Redemption 2. Of course, there is so much more to it than just this, so why not check out all the extra stuff Rockstar crammed into the end credits sequence, or some of our favorite Easter eggs hidden around its massive world.
